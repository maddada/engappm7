Checked: (not the reason)
- Guards
- isUserLoggedIn
- app.component.html
- app.component.ts (not checkfirstlaunch)
- not prev route service
- not showloading and toast services
- not index.html
- auth service




Done testing, didn't find the reason why it's apperaing!

tried upgrading and downgrading zone.js to all the versions people say worked for them
tried installing rxjs-compat
deleted BehaviourSubjects
checked all the files above


It's probably an issue in one of the following components:
app component
tabs component

because if i reload while im in another page it doesn't show up!
